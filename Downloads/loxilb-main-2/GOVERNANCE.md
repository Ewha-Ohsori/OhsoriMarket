## Values

LoxiLB and its leadership embrace the following values:

* Openness: Communication and decision-making happens in the open and is discoverable for future reference. As much as possible, all discussions and work take place in public Slack channels and open repositories.

* Fairness: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and submit contributions, which will be considered on their merits.

* Community over Product or Company: Sustaining and growing our community takes priority over shipping code or sponsors' organizational goals. Each contributor participates in the project as an individual.

* Community Before Individual Demand: As a community-driven open source project, we emphasize the importance of collaboration and contribution. Maintainers and contributors work together towards the project's growth, not to serve unilateral user demands. Users pretending features or enhancements for their sole benefit without contributing to the effort are not aligned with our community values.

* Inclusivity: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, which can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment.

* Participation: Responsibilities within the project are earned through participation, and there is a clear path up the contributor ladder into leadership positions.

## Maintainers

LoxiLB Maintainers have write access to the [LoxiLB GitHub repository](https://github.com/loxilb-io/loxilb). They can merge their own patches or patches from others. The current maintainers
can be found in [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md).  Maintainers collectively manage the project's resources and contributors.

This privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: maintainers are people who care about the LoxiLB project and want to help it grow and
improve. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most
knowledgeable people to review code and docs.

A maintainer is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping the project succeed. The collective team of all Maintainers is known as the Maintainer Council, which
is the governing body for the project.

### Maintainer duties
Maintainers are required to participate in the project, by joining discussions, submitting and reviewing pull requests, answering user questions, among others.

Maintainers are also encouraged to spread the word about LoxiLB.

### Becoming a Maintainer

To become a Maintainer you need to demonstrate the following:

  * commitment to the project:
    * participate in discussions, contributions, code and documentation reviews,
    * perform reviews for non-trivial pull requests,
    * contribute non-trivial pull requests and have them merged,
  * ability to write quality code and/or documentation,
  * ability to collaborate with the team,
  * understanding of how the team works (policies, processes for testing and code review, etc),
  * understanding of the project's purpose, code base and coding and documentation style.

A new Maintainer must be proposed by an existing maintainer by sending a message to all the other existing Maintainers. A simple majority vote of existing Maintainers
approves the application. Maintainers nominations will be evaluated without prejudice
to employer or demographics.

Maintainers who are selected will be granted the necessary GitHub rights.

### Removing a Maintainer

Maintainers may resign at any time if they feel that they will not be able to continue fulfilling their project duties.

Maintainers may also be removed after being inactive, failure to fulfill their 
Maintainer responsibilities, violating the Code of Conduct, or other reasons.
A Maintainer may be removed at any time by a 2/3 vote of the remaining maintainers.

## Voting

While most business in LoxiLB is conducted by "[lazy consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html)", 
periodically the Maintainers may need to vote on specific actions or changes.
Any Maintainer may demand a vote be taken.

Most votes require a simple majority of all Maintainers to succeed, except where
otherwise noted. Two-thirds majority votes mean at least two-thirds of all 
existing maintainers.

## Changes in Governance

Changes to this Governance and its supporting documents may be approved by 
a 2/3 vote of the Maintainers.
