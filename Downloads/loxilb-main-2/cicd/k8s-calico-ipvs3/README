## Test Case Description

This scenario will have K8s(1 Master Nodes & 2 Worker Nodes) cluster with Calico CNI in ipvs mode. LoxiLB will be running as external Service LB. Workloads will be spawned in all the cluster nodes.

Client will be connected to the LoxiLB with L3 network. Client and LoxiLB will run BGP peering. LoxiLB will advertise the Service CIDR or VirtualIP to the client. 
Service CIDR will also be a Virtual IP, different from the K8s cluster network.

In scenarios where LoxiLB runs outside of the cluster, it is advised to create LB services in either one-arm or fullnat mode for ease of connectivity or else user has to resolve connectivity with either static routes or through BGP.
