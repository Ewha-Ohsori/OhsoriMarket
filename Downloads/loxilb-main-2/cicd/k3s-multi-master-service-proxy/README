## Test Case Description

This scenario will have K3s(2 Master Nodes & 2 Worker Nodes) cluster with flannel CNI. LoxiLB will be running in the in-cluster Active-Backup High Availabity mode(in both the master nodes) but without State Syncronization. Workloads will be spawned in all the cluster nodes.

Client will be connected directly to the cluster with L2 network. Service CIDR will also be a Virtual IP from the K3s cluster network.

In in-cluster scenarios, it is advised to create LB services in either one-arm or fullnat mode for ease of connectivity.
